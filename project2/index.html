            <p>All player controls are custom, they could use some better styling when I get to it. Video can be played/paused by clicking on the video or the button. 
                The stop button is the same as pressing pause at this time. The next/prev buttons go to the next or previous videos. The player will automatically move 
                on to the next video as well. The next/prev video is determined by the playlist and the random option. The playlist is rearranged when random is selected.
                The playlist button will show the current order and allow you to select any video. The chapters button will display chapter options to select. The CC button 
                will show caption options including captions, subtitles and descriptions. The full screen button will make the video full screen. Custom controls are not 
                available in full screen at this time. You can adjust the volume with the slider as well as muting with the button. On un-mute it restores previous volume.
                The progress bar shows the current position as well as all buffered areas which ay be confusing to some at first. Clicking in the progress bar will move to 
                that position in the video. Progress bar drag has not been implemented yet. Clicking on chapters or captions when displayed will take you to that position 
                of the video.</p>

            <summary>Code Details</summary>
            <p>There are a lot of options that can still be added. There are some minor issues to be fixed like disabling chapters button if the video doesn't have a 
                chapters file. There are some small issues at certain sizes and some sizes are hard coded which can be fixed. The code can certainly be refactored, 
                cleaned up and reorganized. In the case of captions and chapters, a lot of the code is similar and could be generalized. More and better comments can 
                be added. A lot of stuff would have been easier ith jQuery and other modules but the point was to do it in pure HTML, CSS and JS. Alas, that is all the 
                time I have to spend on it for now. I will likely revisit it in the future.</p>

                I have uploaded the Elephants Dream videos, subtitles and chapters to Dropbox. They are being server from there. The Big
                Buck Bunny video is very large and therefore listed last in case you want to avoid them. The Sintel video
                is only in mp4 and is the only other one with subtitles. The Caminades video is only in mp4 and is direct
                from their site.
